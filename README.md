## API Integration
The Weather App website integrates with a weather-based API to fetch weather data. You can choose any reliable weather API that provides the necessary data (such as temperature, conditions, humidity, wind speed, etc.) in a JSON format.

In the JavaScript code (script.js), locate the section where the API call is made and replace the placeholder API URL with the actual URL of the weather API you're using.
